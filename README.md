This package provides **Neurotune**, a package for optimizing electical models of excitable cells.

**This package was originally developed by [Mike Vella](https://github.com/vellamike). This has been updated by [Padraig Gleeson](https://github.com/pgleeson) and others (and moved to [NeuralEnsemble](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble)) to continue development of [pyelectro](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/pyelectro) and [Neurotune](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/neurotune) for use in [OpenWorm](http://www.openworm.org/), [Open Source Brain](http://opensourcebrain.org/) and other projects**

Full documentation can be found [here](http://neurotune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Installation

Install Neurotune with the following command:
```
sudo pip install .

```

The developer dependencies can be installed using the `dev` extra:

```
sudo pip install .[dev]
```

The [CI script](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/neurotune/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml) shows the full set of commands for installation & execution of a number of examples.
